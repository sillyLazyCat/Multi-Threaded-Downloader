# Multi-Threaded Downloader 

Ayo dawg, this ain't your grandma's downloader, nah fr 😭. This shi uses **INSANE** thread counts to finesse slow download speeds and absolutely **CLOWN** throttling. Get ur files **FAST AF** 🚀💨.

## 🛠 Features
- **Multi-threaded supremacy** 🧵 upto 200 (or whatever ur PC can handle b4 combusting 💀)
- **Bypass throttling** 💨💨 (they can't stop all of us, bro)
- **Real-time thread visualization** 📊 (watch dem little squares go brrr 🟩🟩🟩)
  
## 📥 How to Use
1. **Drop the File URL** 🔗 (paste that bad boi in)
2. **Set ur Threads**
   - More threads = more server load, so don't go full throttle unless u wanna nuke the server.
   - Find that sweet spot where speed is fire.
   - Hold Shift while adjusting thread count to unlock 1000 threads (use at ur own risk, dawg 💀🔥).
3. **Smash Download**
